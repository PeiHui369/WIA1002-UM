Imagine a pile of books on your desk. Each book is so large and heavy and you call only remove the top one from the pile. You cannot remove a book from under another one. Likewise, you can add another book to the pile only by placing it on the top of the pile. You cannot add a book beneath one another and can only remove the pile’s top book.

Considering all of the given information above:

Design a stack interface, Slacklnterface<E> lhat you can use to specify common methods for any stack object that implements this interface. The i’nterface should specify the following common attribute and methods.
•	An attribute that ls an ArrayList lo store the elements in this stack.
•	A constructor that creates ao empty stack.
•	A method that returns the number of elements in this stack.
•	A method that returns the top element in this stack.
•	A method that returns and removes the top element in this stack.
•	A method that adds a new element to the top of this stack.
•	A method that returns true if the slack is empty.

If you represent books by their titles, design a stack generic class, GenericStack<E> that implement the Slacklnterface<E>, you cart use it to track the books in the pile on your desk. Implement the methods using ArrayList. This class should override the Java hosting method to return the list of elements in this stack.

Write a test program, TestPileStack that demonstrates your implementation. An example of the output for the test program is as follows:
Push 3 books to the pile:
Enter book title 1: The Hobbit
Enter book title 2: The Lord of the Rings
Enter book title 3: The Da Vinci Cade

The new books that you added are: {The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Da Vinci Code]

The pile should not be empty: isEmpty() returns false
The pile has 3 books.
Get the top book and remove the top book:

The Da Vinci Gode is at the top of the pile. The Da Vinci Code is removed from the pile.

The Lord of the Rings is at the top of the pile. The Lord of the Rings Is removed from the pl!e.

The Hobbit is at the top of the pile. The Hobbit is removed from the pile.

The pile should be empty: isEmpty() returns true

Write a test program, TestPileStack that demonstrates your implementation. An example of the output for the test program is as follows:
Create a new stack: an empty pile of books isEmpty() returns true
Push 3 books to the pile:
Enter book title 1: The Hobbit
Enter book title 2: The Lord of the Rings
Enter book title 3: The Da Vinci Cade

The new books that you added are: {The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Da Vinci Code]

The pile should not be empty: isEmpty() returns false
The pile has 3 books.
Get the top book and remove the top book:

The Da Vinci Gode is at the top of the pile. The Da Vinci Code is removed from the pile.

The Lord of the Rings is at the top of the pile. The Lord of the Rings Is removed from the pile.

The Hobbit is at the top of the pile. The Hobbit is removed from the pile.

The pile should be empty: isEmpty() returns true


=============================================================================================================================
Here's an example implementation in Java of the `StackInterface` and `GenericStack` classes:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

interface StackInterface<E> {
    int size();
    E top();
    E pop();
    void push(E element);
    boolean isEmpty();
}

class GenericStack<E> implements StackInterface<E> {
    private ArrayList<E> stack;

    public GenericStack() {
        stack = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public int size() {
        return stack.size();
    }

    public E top() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Stack is empty");
        }
        return stack.get(stack.size() - 1);
    }

    public E pop() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Stack is empty");
        }
        return stack.remove(stack.size() - 1);
    }

    public void push(E element) {
        stack.add(element);
    }

    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return stack.toString();
    }
}
```

And here's a test program `TestPileStack` that demonstrates the usage of the `GenericStack` class:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TestPileStack {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GenericStack<String> pile = new GenericStack<>();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Push 3 books to the pile:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter book title " + i + ": ");
            String title = scanner.nextLine();
            pile.push(title);
        }

        System.out.println("\nThe new books that you added are: " + pile);
        System.out.println("The pile should not be empty: isEmpty() returns " + !pile.isEmpty());
        System.out.println("The pile has " + pile.size() + " books.");

        System.out.println("\nGet the top book and remove the top book:");
        while (!pile.isEmpty()) {
            String topBook = pile.top();
            System.out.println(topBook + " is at the top of the pile. " + topBook + " is removed from the pile.");
            pile.pop();
        }

        System.out.println("\nThe pile should be empty: isEmpty() returns " + pile.isEmpty());

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

When you run the `TestPileStack` program, it prompts you to enter the titles of three books, then it demonstrates the operations on the stack. It prints the stack after adding books, checks if the stack is empty, gets the top book and removes it until the stack is empty, and finally checks if the stack is empty again.
