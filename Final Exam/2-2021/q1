Write the sequence of the nodes if the tree is traversed with:
inorder traversal
postorder traversal
Redraw the tree if nodes 66 and 27 are deleted.
=======================================================================================================
The sequence of nodes when the tree is traversed with different traversal methods and the redrawn tree after deleting nodes 66 and 27 are as follows:

Inorder Traversal: 13 -> 25 -> 18 -> 28 -> 30 -> 27 -> 39 -> 33 -> 41 -> 42 -> 45 -> 66 -> 80 -> 82
Postorder Traversal: 18 -> 28 -> 25 -> 30 -> 33 -> 41 -> 42 -> 39 -> 27 -> 66 -> 82 -> 80 -> 45 -> 13

Redrawn Tree after deleting nodes 66 and 27:
```
        45
       /  \
      28   82
     /   \    \
    13   39   80
   /    /   \     
  25   30    42  
 /            \
18            41
```
