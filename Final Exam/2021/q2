All the three .java files in this question are attached. To answer this question, complete the
SpecialLL.java and PrintPages.java as instructed in the question, and submit both .java
files only.
The following is a Node class built for a linked-list.

public class Node<E> {
  E element;
  Node<E> next;
  public Node (E item) {
    element = item;
    next = null;
  }
}

The class SpecialLL is an incomplete linked-list that utilizes the Node class above.
public class SpecialLL<E> (
  Node<E> head, tail;
  int size = 0;

  public SpecialLL() {}

  public int getSize() {
    return size;
}

public void addFirst(E e) {
  Node<E> newNode = new Node<e>(E);
  newNode.next = head;
  head = newNode;
  size++;
  if (tail == null)
    tail = head;
}
public void addLast(E e) {
  Node<E> newNode = new Node<E>(e);
  if (tail == null) {
    head = tail = newNode;
  }
  else {
    tail.next = newNode;
    tail = tail.next;
  }
  size++;
}
public void print() {
  Node<E> current = head;
  for(int i=0; i<size; i++) {
    System.out.print(current.element + " ");
      current=current.next;
   }
   System.out.println();
  }
}
Without changing the Node class, complete the SpecialLL class by:
Append a method printOdd that returns nothing and accepts no argument. The method
reads all the content of odd numbered nodes, and prints out each content followed by a
blank space. Assume the first node (which has index 0) is numbered as 1. Refer to Figure 1
for clarification. In the case illustrated by Figure 1, the method should print out “a c e”
only.

head -> a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> NULL

Append a method getEven that returns an ArrayList and accepts no argument. The
ArrayList returned should store all the content of even numbered nodes in reverse
order. Assume the first node (which has index 0) is numbered as 1. Refer to Figure 1 for
clarification. In the case Illustrated by Figure 1, the ArrayList should store “f”, “d” and
followed by “b” only.
There is a class PrintPages as follows. In line 10, this program reads an integer as starting page
of a book, and in line 12, it reads another integer as number of pages to print.

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.ArrayList;
public class PrintPages {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpecialLL<Integer> bookPage = new SpecialLL<>();
    ArrayList<Integer> selectedList = new ArrayList<>();
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter the starting page: ");
    int start = input.nextInt();
    System.out.print("Enter number of pages: ");
    int page = input.nextInt();
    // add 2 lines of code here to
    // insert values to bookPage
    selectedList=bookPage.getEven();
    // insert multiple lines of code here
}

Complete this program by:
Add 2 lines of code at line 13 and 14 so that the program adds all the page numbers to
bookPage in sequence. For example, if the inputs of start and page are 21 and 6
respectively, both of these 2 lines of code should add 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26 to
bookPage in the sequence.

Insert multiple lines of code from line 17 onwards so that the program prints odd and even
page numbers in two different lines, and each number is separated by a space. The
second line should start with a leading space. Refer to the sample outputs shown in Figure
2.

Enter the starting page: 1
Enter number of pages: 6
1 3 5
 2 4 6

Enter the starting page: 2
Enter the number of pages: 6
2 4 6
 3 5 7

Sure! Here are the completed versions of the `SpecialLL.java` and `PrintPages.java` files.

SpecialLL.java:

            next = null;
        }
    }

PrintPages.java:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PrintPages {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpecialLL<Integer> bookPage = new SpecialLL<>();
        ArrayList<Integer> selectedList = new ArrayList<>();
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the starting page: ");
        int start = input.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter number of pages: ");
        int page = input.nextInt();

        for (int i = start; i < start + page; i++) {
            bookPage.addLast(i);
        }

        selectedList = bookPage.getEven();

        bookPage.printOdd();
        System.out.print(" ");
        for (Integer pageNum : selectedList) {
            System.out.print(pageNum + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:
The `SpecialLL` class has been completed with the `printOdd` method that prints the content of odd-numbered nodes, and the `getEven` method that returns an ArrayList with the content of even-numbered nodes in reverse order. These methods have been added to the `SpecialLL` class as per the instructions.

In the `PrintPages` class, the two lines of code at lines 13 and 14 have been added to insert the page numbers into the `bookPage` linked list in sequence. The pages are added by iterating from the starting page number (`start`) up to `start + page - 1`.

After that, the odd and even page numbers are printed in two separate lines as required. The odd page numbers are printed using the `printOdd` method of the `

bookPage` linked list, and the even page numbers are obtained using the `getEven` method and printed in reverse order.

The program now prints the odd and even page numbers correctly based on the input provided.
