To reverse the first k elements of a queue, you can use an additional stack to temporarily hold the elements. Here's a solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.Stack;

public class QueueReverser {

    public static void reverseFirstKElements(Queue<Integer> queue, int k) {
        if (k < 0 || k > queue.size()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid value of k.");
        }

        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        // Push the first k elements into the stack
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            stack.push(queue.poll());
        }

        // Enqueue the elements from the stack back into the queue
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            queue.offer(stack.pop());
        }

        // Rotate the remaining elements in the queue
        for (int i = 0; i < queue.size() - k; i++) {
            queue.offer(queue.poll());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(1);
        queue.offer(2);
        queue.offer(3);
        queue.offer(4);
        queue.offer(5);

        System.out.println("Queue before reversing: " + queue);

        int k = 3;
        reverseFirstKElements(queue, k);

        System.out.println("Queue after reversing first " + k + " elements: " + queue);
    }
}
```

In this solution, the `reverseFirstKElements` method takes a queue of integers and an integer value `k`, representing the number of elements to reverse.

The method first checks if the value of `k` is valid (between 0 and the size of the queue, inclusive). If `k` is invalid, it throws an exception.

It creates a stack to temporarily hold the first `k` elements of the queue.

It uses a loop to dequeue the first `k` elements from the queue and push them into the stack.

Then, it uses another loop to enqueue the elements from the stack back into the queue.

Finally, it rotates the remaining elements in the queue by dequeueing each element and enqueueing it again, `queue.size() - k` times.

In the `main` method, we create a queue with some elements, call the `reverseFirstKElements` method to reverse the first `k` elements (in this case, `k = 3`), and print the queue before and after reversing to verify the result.

------------------------------------
The code snippet `for(int i = 0; i<queue.size()-k; i++){ queue.offer(queue.poll()); }` is used to rotate the remaining elements in the queue after reversing the first `k` elements.

Let's break down how this code works step by step:

1. The loop is executed `queue.size() - k` times. This ensures that the remaining elements in the queue (elements after the reversed section) are rotated back to their original order.

2. In each iteration of the loop, the following operations are performed:
   - `queue.offer(queue.poll())`: This operation dequeues an element from the front of the queue using `poll()` and then enqueues it at the rear of the queue using `offer()`. Essentially, it takes the first element and moves it to the end of the queue.
   - This process continues for `queue.size() - k` iterations, effectively rotating the remaining elements in the queue.

By executing this code, the remaining elements in the queue after reversing the first `k` elements will be rotated back to their original order. This ensures that the overall order of the elements in the queue is preserved.
