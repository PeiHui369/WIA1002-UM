Keep two stacks, let's call them inbox and outbox.

Enqueue:
Push the new element onto inbox

Dequeue:
If outbox is empty, refill it by popping each element from inbox and pushing it onto outbox
Pop and return the top element from outbox

//Complexity Analysis: In the worst case scenario when outbox stack is empty, the algorithm pops n elements from inbox stack and pushes n elements to outbox, where n is the queue size. This gives 2*n operations, which is O(n). But when outbox stack is not empty the algorithm has O(1) time complexity that gives amortised O(1).
