In this representation, the nodes node1 and node2 each contain a single character, 'a' and 'z' respectively. 
The arrows indicate the references head and tail that point to node1 and node2, respectively. 
The empty boxes below the nodes represent the remainder of the node structure, which is not shown in this simplified representation.

//Set node1's next reference to node2
node1.next = node2;

T4Q1e
If we have no information about the status of the linked list, we need to consider the following conditions before adding the firstNode at the beginning of the list:
If the linked list is empty, then firstNode becomes the head of the list.
If the linked list is not empty, then we need to set the next reference of firstNode to point to the current head node, and then update the head reference to point to firstNode.

T4Q1f
1. Create a new node called firstNode
2. If the linked list is empty:
     1. Set head to firstNode
3. If the linked list is not empty:
     1. Set the next reference of firstNode to point to the current head node
     2. Set head to firstNode

T4Q1g
Node<Character> firstNode = new Node<>('f');
if(head == null){
        head = firstNode;
 }else{
        firstNode.next = head;
        head = firstNode;
 }
 //this code assumes that the head reference is already declared and initialized to null if the linked list is empty.

Node.addLast('c')
Node.add(3,d);
Node.removeFirst;
Node.removeLast;
Node.remove(1);
