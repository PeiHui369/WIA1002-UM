bfs
Examine layer by layer (Step by step)
slower (Consider every single option, have benchmarking)
Can find the shortest path
- based on vertex

dfs
Find 1 solution and stop
quicker (X examine neighbours)
May trapped in infinite loop (if any node have self looping)
- based on edges

(time complexity same)
Space complexity: bfs > dfs
