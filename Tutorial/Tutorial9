Question 1
public static int f(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return 1;
    else
        return n * f(n-1);
}

//
The recursive method `f(n)` calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. However, there is an issue when executing the method with an input of `0`, i.e., `f(0)`.

Let's go through the execution of `f(0)` step by step:

1. The method is called with `n` equal to `0`.
2. The condition `n == 1` is checked. Since `0` is not equal to `1`, the else block is executed.
3. The method returns `n * f(n-1)`, which becomes `0 * f(-1)`.

At this point, we encounter a problem because the next recursive call is `f(-1)`. In subsequent recursive calls, the value of `n` keeps decreasing by `1` each time until it reaches a negative value. This leads to an infinite recursion loop, resulting in a `StackOverflowError`.

To fix this issue and make the method work correctly, we need to update the base case condition to check for `n == 0` and return `1` when `n` equals `0`. Here's the updated code:

```java
public static int f(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return 1;
    else
        return n * f(n-1);
}
```

With this fix, when `n` is `0`, the base case will be triggered, and the method will return `1` immediately. This ensures that the factorial calculation works correctly for all positive integers and handles the special case of `0` appropriately.

Question 2
public static int f(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return 0;
    else if (n > 0)
        return f(n - 1) + n;
    else
        return f(n + 1) + n;
}

---
The recursive method `f(n)` appears to calculate the sum of all positive integers from `n` to `0`. However, there is a problem when executing the method due to an infinite recursion loop.

Let's walk through the execution of `f(n)` step by step:

1. The method is called with a value of `n`.
2. The condition `n == 0` is checked. If `n` is equal to `0`, the method should return `0`. However, in this case, the method returns `n` (which is `0`) without proceeding to the else block.
3. If the method reaches the else block, it executes the statement `return f(n+1) + n`. This implies that the method will call itself with an incremented value of `n` (`n+1`).
4. Due to the recursive call, the method starts an infinite loop where it continuously calls itself with `n+1`. Since there is no termination condition that will break the loop, it results in an infinite recursion.

As a result, executing the method `f()` will eventually lead to a `StackOverflowError` due to the infinite recursion loop.

To resolve this issue, we need to adjust the termination condition in the base case. Instead of checking `n == 0`, we should check for a specific condition that stops the recursion and returns a value without further recursive calls.

Here's an example of a corrected implementation that calculates the sum of all positive integers from `n` to `0`:

```java
public static int f(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return 0;
    else if (n > 0)
        return f(n - 1) + n;
    else
        return f(n + 1) + n;
}
```

In this updated code, if `n` is equal to `0`, the base case is triggered, and the method returns `0`. Additionally, we added an extra condition `n > 0` to handle the case where `n` is negative. In this case, the method recursively calls itself with `n-1` to move closer to `0`.

By properly handling the termination conditions, we avoid the infinite recursion loop and allow the method to calculate the desired sum of positive integers correctly.

Question 3
public class StringReverser {
    public static String reverseString(String str) {
        // Base case: if the string is empty or has only one character, it's already reversed
        if (str.length() <= 1) {
            return str;
        }
        
        // Recursive case: reverse the substring starting from the second character and concatenate it with the first character
        return reverseString(str.substring(1)) + str.charAt(0);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String original = "Hello, World!";
        String reversed = reverseString(original);
        System.out.println("Original string: " + original);
        System.out.println("Reversed string: " + reversed);
    }
}

---
In this example, the `reverseString()` method takes a string as an argument and recursively reverses it. 
The base case checks if the string has zero or one character and returns it as is. 
In the recursive case, the method recursively calls itself with a substring starting from the second character and concatenates it with the first character of the original string. 
Finally, in the `main()` method, an example string is reversed using the `reverseString()` method, and both the original and reversed strings are printed.

Question 4

To calculate the sum of numbers from `N` to 1:

public class NumberSumCalculator {
    public static int calculateSum(int n) {
        // Base case: when n is 1, return 1
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }

        // Recursive case: sum n with the sum of numbers from (n-1) to 1
        return n + calculateSum(n - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = 5;
        int sum = calculateSum(N);
        System.out.println("Sum of numbers from " + N + " to 1: " + sum);
    }
}

---
In this code, the `calculateSum()` method takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of numbers from `n` down to 1.

The algorithm consists of two cases:

1. Base case: When `n` is equal to 1, we have reached the smallest number in the series. In this case, we return 1 as the sum of that single number.
2. Recursive case: For any other positive value of `n`, we add `n` to the sum of the numbers from `(n-1)` down to 1. This is achieved by recursively calling the `calculateSum()` method with `n-1` and adding `n` to the result.

By following this algorithm, we can calculate the sum of numbers from `N` down to 1 recursively.

For example, if we set `N` to 5, the trace of the recursive calls would be as follows:

```
calculateSum(5)
    |
    └── calculateSum(4)
        |
        └── calculateSum(3)
            |
            └── calculateSum(2)
                |
                └── calculateSum(1)
```

The base case is reached when `n` is 1, and the method returns 1. As the recursion unwinds, the sums are calculated and returned as follows:

```
calculateSum(5) = 5 + calculateSum(4)
calculateSum(4) = 4 + calculateSum(3)
calculateSum(3) = 3 + calculateSum(2)
calculateSum(2) = 2 + calculateSum(1)
calculateSum(1) = 1
```

Question 5

To print an integer argument as its constituent digits with a space between each digit:

public class DigitPrinter {
    public static void printDigit(int number) {
        if (number < 10) {
            // Base case: if number is a single digit, print it
            System.out.print(number + " ");
        } else {
            // Recursive case: print the digits of number/10, then print the last digit
            printDigit(number / 10);
            System.out.print(number % 10 + " ");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 4567;
        System.out.print("Digits of " + number + ": ");
        printDigit(number);
    }
}

---
In this code, the `printDigit()` method takes an integer `number` as input and prints its constituent digits separated by a space.

The algorithm consists of two cases:

1. Base case: If the `number` is less than 10, it means that it is a single digit. In this case, we simply print the `number`.
2. Recursive case: For any `number` greater than or equal to 10, we recursively call `printDigit()` with `number/10` to print the digits before the last digit, and then we print the last digit (`number % 10`).

By following this algorithm, we can print the constituent digits of an integer recursively.

For example, when `number` is set to 4567, the method calls will be:

```
printDigit(4567)
    |
    └── printDigit(456)
        |
        └── printDigit(45)
            |
            └── printDigit(4)
                |
                └── printDigit(0)
```

As the recursion unwinds, the digits are printed:

```
printDigit(0) prints: 0
printDigit(4) prints: 4
printDigit(45) prints: 4 5
printDigit(456) prints: 4 5 6
printDigit(4567) prints: 4 5 6 7
```

The final result is the constituent digits of the input number, 4567, printed with a space separating each digit: "4 5 6 7".

The final result is the sum of the numbers from 5 down to 1, which is 15.
