The 'MyLinkedList' class is a generic class that takes a type parameter 'E' to represent the type of elements stored in the linked list.
The class has two instance variables 'head' and 'tail', which are of type 'Node<E>' and represent the first and last nodes of the linked list.
The constructor initializes both 'head' and 'tail' to 'null', creating an empty linked list.
Note that the 'Node' class is not shown here, but it would need to be defined separately.
