My name is Lee Pei Hui with matrix number, 22004781. I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because I am passionate about Data Structure and the prospect of gaining knowledge and skills in a particular area are energizing and motivating. I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will focus during the class and learn from my lecturer as while as completing a tons of programming practices. Wish me luck!!!
