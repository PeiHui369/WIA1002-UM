Write a program that contains a generic method that reverses the order of the elements
within a stack data structure using recursion. In addition, write the main method to test
the static method. Two sets of test data should be used in the main method: i) {“Switch”,
“Motherboard”, “RAM”, “SSD”, “CPU”, “GPU”, “Router”}; and ii) {17, 21, 45, 23, 1, 99,
16}. No marks will be awarded if the stack and recursion concepts are not applied in the
program.

- reverse order of ele within a stack using recursion
- main method to test static method
- 2 sets of test data:
i {"Switch", "Motherboard", "RAM", "SSD", "CPU", "GPU", "Router"}
ii {17, 21, 45, 23, 1, 99, 16}
